Design a simple number guessing game where:

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.

The user tries to guess the number.

After each guess, the program should tell the user whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Count and display the number of attempts when the user guesses correctly.

 Allow resetting the game.
