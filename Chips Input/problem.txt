Problem Statement:
Chips Input: Users should be able to input text into a field, and when they press the "Enter" key, the text should be added to a list of chips.

Displaying Chips: The entered chips should be displayed below the input field.

Removing Chips: Each chip should have a way to be removed by clicking on it (typically a small "X" next to the chip).

Example Behavior:
Input: The user types "React" and presses Enter.

Output: The word "React" appears as a chip.

Remove: Clicking the "X" on the chip removes it.

Key Requirements for the Solution:
State Management: You need to manage an array of chips.

Event Handling: Handle key events (like Enter to add a chip) and mouse events (like click to remove a chip).

Conditional Rendering: Display chips only if the list is not empty.
